That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.\nStabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no \xe2\x80\x9csurprises\xe2\x80\x9d in store before calming down again.\nThis breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct.\xc2\xa0The Staby\xe2\x80\x99s build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long.

They are a working breed and happiest when they have a function to perform. Regular exercise is important both physically and mentally, and doing activities together strengthens the bond between dog and owner. Siberians were bred to run and will do so at every opportunity; it is vital to keep the dog on a leash, in harness, or in a fenced yard at all times. There are several AKC-sponsored activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owners\xe2\x80\x94rally, agility, and obedience are a few. A busy and active Siberian is a happy and healthy Siberian.

Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time dog owners.

It always received respectful attitude from its human family, which treated it as its member rather than a simple domestic animal. This means that it developed into a fabulous companion dog, devoted, lively and biddable. The breed is extremely gentle and considerate with children to whom it commonly establishes especially tight bonds. Nevertheless its friendly nature doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exclude the necessity of a certain amount of socialization, preferably at an early age.\nThe Yakutian Laika is slightly reserved with unknown people but in most cases it\xe2\x80\x99s excited to acquire a new playmate.

However its barking is no more than a means to show its anticipation of the perspective of making a new acquaintance.

The breed is a good one for an active family with plenty of acreage. English Foxhounds are not recommended for city or apartment living, as their space will be too confined. They are high-energy dogs, but with the proper amount of exercise, they are gentle, social, and relaxed indoors. Since they are bred to run for miles, they can make good hiking and running companions. Daily long, brisk walks are important for this breed. As scent hounds, they may want to run off and explore an interesting scent, so it is important to keep the dog on leash unless in a safely enclosed area.

Drents have a single coat, like Setters and Brittanys and shed twice per year.

Use the comb to loosen and get the bulk of the hair, which is ready to come out. Follow with the pin brush; it\xe2\x80\x99ll do a nice job of sweeping up the rest. At this point you are likely to see dander, and so enters the boar brush. The boar bristles will clean that up, and will help distribute the natural oils and get the coat nice and shiny.

Certainly some individuals may suffer from any canine malady, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t representative across the breed as a common issue or health concern. From a genetic standpoint, the Drent has only a few hereditary diseases to know about and monitor in order to keep incidences low.\nThe Drent\xe2\x80\x99s eyes should be monitored for the following hereditary diseases: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), Distichiasis, Entropion and Ectropion, Persistent Pupillay Membranes (PPM), and Retinal Dysplasisa. Other diseases or abnormalities which have been found in the Drent are: hemophilia, hypothyroidism, cryptorchidism, hyperuricosuria, significant reactions to poisonous insect bites/stings and the absence of certain teeth.\nLike many breeds, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia should be monitored and all breeding stock screened for. Joint dysplasia is influenced by genetics and environment, so using care during the Drents\xe2\x80\x99 rapid growth period is advisable.\nAmongst breed authorities, Epilepsy is considered to be the greatest current health threat to the Drent. Still, incidence rates remain undocumented and unverified; the locus of the disease in the Drent has not been located.\nThe most common, but usually non-problematic, is von Willebrand disease type-I (vWD-I). Despite a high incidence rate of carriers and affected dogs in the population, Drents do not present the disease in clinical terms, despite what modern science has to say about the issue. Paw Print Genetics has studied this phenomenon and their findings were validated by Cornell University. Von Willebrand disease type-I is detectable by the Paw Print Genetics DNA health panel.
